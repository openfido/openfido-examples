# Loadshape examples

The following examples are for the `https://github.com/openfido/loadshape` pipeline on `debian:11`, `main` branch, running the script `openfido.sh`.

## Example 1

This example illustrates a simple loadshape analysis for a small sample AMI dataset covering 100 customers over 2 years.

## Example 2

This example illustrates a simple loadshape analysis for the same AMI dataset as Example 1 with GridLAB-D model components.

## Example 3

This example uses a much larger AMI dataset (~1000 homes) and generates the same outputs as Example 2.
