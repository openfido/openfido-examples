# Example 1

This example illustrates a simple loadshape analysis for a small sample AMI dataset covering 100 customers over 2 years.

# Example 2

This example illustrates a simple loadshape analysis for the same AMI dataset as Example 1 with GridLAB-D model components.

# Example 3

This example uses a much larger AMI dataset (~1000 homes) and generates the same outputs as Example 2.
